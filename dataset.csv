8,Gallo,Apothic174 Red Blend - 750ml Bottle,2017-12-15T00:02:24Z,,1,2,1.0 lbs,A Sweet Red.,"I would give one more star if it came clean on the bottle and called itself a 'sweet red'. Instead it get's poetic and grandiose about itself when all it is is a blend which (standard practice) gets a dash of grape juice concentrate to sweeten it. It also looses a star for the price, I rather look to the side of my Target's shelves and pick-up a Lambrusco for about 3-4 less."

Someone had given me a bottle and I liked the look of it so much that I didn't want to open it. Had no idea it was so nicely priced and so easily available. Finally opened it when I was in a bind, needing white wine for a favorite holiday recipe and this was all I had on hand. It's a nice, smooth Pinot, very nice flavor, pleasurable to the palate. What I especially love about this brand, however, is the bottle itself! Screw off the black top and there is a smaller neck with a cork closure. The beauty is that the black cap is designed so that it will reseal the bottle without the cork needing to be squeezed back in...a really thoughtful design. I almost hate to admit how much I was impressed by it! Will be stopping by Target specifically to buy more to have in the house. Highly recommend."

It is an eminently drinkable wine,as a matter of fact it is my preferred, and go to, table wine. Wine is a personal thing but for me it is my 1 pick in the under 10 category. It is well balanced, subtle, and very easy to sip. Dry without being overpowering. It is not a big bad Cabernet but it is not that in a good way. Goes great by itself or paired with cheese or a dish sauced with something heavier like a bernaise. I always have a bottle on my shelf."

However, BOTH bottles broke while removing the corkscrew. Second break was far enough I didn't want to risk drinking it because of risk of glass shards. I've bought cheaper wines like yellowtail, etc, and NEVER experienced a bottle breaking."
46,California Roots,California Roots Chardonnay White Wine - 750ml,2017-11-19T10:27:27Z,TRUE,,4,2.65 lbs,Great Wine For The Price.,"I didnt find this to be sweet at all, but everyones taste differs. I usually dont like sweet wines so I gravitate towards Chardonnay and some Sauvignon Blancs and I felt like this one had more of a buttery taste than a sweet citrusy taste like another reviewer stated. For the price, this is definitely a keeper."

136,Corona Light,Corona Light174 Beer - 6pk / 12oz Bottles,2015-10-30T21:55:56Z,,,,1.0 lbs,Very good tea.....,I don't know why some people wrote bad reviews about this tea. It is just like the tea I've grown up with that I had in Chinese Restaurants. The only complaint I have is that I found the same tea while visiting an Asian store out of town and it was only 2.00 per box while this one was more than double plus a 2.99 shipping fee. I knocked the rating down one star because of the outrageous price this seller charges.

I used to receive a tea bag or two from my favorite Chinese take out, but nobody does that anymore. I'd save my teabag for the next day to drink with the leftovers, to enhance the leftovers. Now, I can enjoy this tea anytime. This is a refreshing tea that does not make one feel as if we should be adding milk and/or eating some cookies or cakes with it. This tea can stand alone and refresh the inner soul. I drink it with just a pinch of sugar."

Hard to find in stores where I live.","I really like this tea and have bought it many times. The blend called Chinese Restaurant Tea is a blend of green, oolong and jasmine. It doesn't contain ginseng or black tea, which might explain why some people don't like it. (Black tea is more common and smoother tasting than green, which can be grassy or sharp tasting.) It does taste like the teas I have had at better Asian restaurants. (Some of the cheapo ones don't even serve tea any more.)I like the packaging and the name. Kind of quirky, stripped down and charming to my mind. It is hard for me to find this tea in stores. I called the company and they said it was only available in certain regions. (My store had carried it but stopped apparently due to this regional issue -- no longer available in our part of PA.) It was much cheaper in the store than it is on-line but I am just glad to have found it! Thanks for carrying it, Amazon and friends!"

142,Corona Light,Corona Light174 Beer - 6pk / 12oz Bottles,2015-10-30T21:55:56Z,,,,1.0 lbs,"Good taste, but is it real Ginseng","I really like the taste of the tea, especially cold. It's a green tea mixed with Ginseng, and they've added licorice root to perhaps sweeten the tea. I don't even add any sugar or honey to it, the taste is that good. My only complaint is that the box claims it is 100 natural, but I wish they would disclose the amount and type of Ginseng. I bought this tea because of the Ginseng, so it would be nice if they disclosed what type of Ginseng and what concentration of it is in the tea itself. Since this is a pretty inexpensive tea, I'm guessing it's a cheap low-quality Ginseng, but like I said, it is tasty. Another nice benefit of this tea is that you can just drop the tea bag into a glass of room temperature water and drink it that way, it's very tasty this way! You don't have to steep or brew it with hot water, so it makes it a nice drinkable tea year round."

The classic iced tea tastes just like what it says... classic iced tea. The citrus is like if you were to squeeze a lemon into a glass of tea. The green tea latte is a bit strange. It tastes a lot like caramel, but also has a tea flavor to it. Its good as well. Also the shipping was great. I ordered it on a Friday and got it the next Monday. Overall, some of the greatest hard candy i've ever tried, and by far, the best tea candy."

291,Patron,Patron174 Silver Tequila - 375ml Bottle,2015-08-22T06:40:02Z,,,,1.0 lbs,Great way to try all three flavors...,"This little 3-pack assortment is a great way to try all three flavors of Bali's Best Tea Candy. Previously, I had purchased a single pack of the Citrus Green Tea, from a specialty shop. It was so incredible... I wish I had bought about 10 packs of it.Upon reading reviews, I thought the Classic Iced Tea might be to my liking as well. I am not a big fan of green tea latte, but thought that I should give it a try, since other people raved about it so much. I was right. The Green Tea Latte was my least favorite of the three. It reminded me a little of green tea ice cream. Okay once in a while, but not an every day treat for me. I prefer the crisp/clear taste, over the creamy/milky flavor. Just personal preference.Now, I simply cannot decide which of the other 2 flavors I love more. They are so incredible tasting, and smooth textured. I love both the astringency and the acidity. They are perfectly balanced, and the flavors play like a melody on the palate. If I could, I would order a case of each of them... just so I could have them on hand all the time. They are by far, my favorite candy, bar none. No pun intended. :)*Note to sellers, I refuse to pay 5 or 6 shipping on a single 1.99 bag of candy. This is absolutely ludicrous. Get real! Before doing that, I will buy a case of 12 packs from a vendor offering free shipping."

There aren't many really good lime mixers out there in the Low to NO Calorie category, so when I discovered SCALES on the shelf while visiting in Scottsdale AZ (for a reasonable 6.99 bottle), I was delighted to discover how tangy limey good it tastes- just right for excellent margaritas, but cutting about 100-150 calories out of your cocktail!I was dismayed when I returned home (though not exactly surprised) to find that Scales was not available in Washington state. So when I looked for it on Amazon and saw its other flavors offered on prime for 7.99 and the Margarita was offered at 17, I thought this must be for two or three bottles. When only one showed up... well, what the hell.Still a great mixer, but why can't we get it for a reasonable price!!"

For the price and the many highly positive reviews, I had really expected something much tastier. I added the juice of two limes but still didn't care for the flavor compared to regular (not sugar-free) but less expensive margarita mixes I've tried. My spouse threw out his drink after one taste. We threw away the bottle so as not to waste any more tequila with this mix."

563,Peychauds,Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - 10 oz,2016-01-18T14:58:07Z,,,,12 ounces,The best,I love a good champagne cocktail and this brand of bitters is MUCH better than the bitters found at the grocery store.
564,Peychauds,Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - 10 oz,2016-01-18T14:58:07Z,,,,12 ounces,Bitters are the cure for whatever ails you...,"Peychaud's is a great way to expand your bitters collection, especially if all you have is the classic Angostura.It's got some nice anise, cherry and other notes in there, and is perfect for a wide variety of cocktails. You can't always use it as a straight up exchange for Angostura, but a lot of times you can. It'll give your cocktail a whole different stir.But why stop at alcoholic drinks Use bitters in all kinds of beverages, both soft and hard.A few dashes of Peychaud's in your root beer or cola will transform it into something sublime. The usually muted vanilla and caramel aromatics will really burst forth.And the perfect hangover cure is lots of bitters and soda.Grab a bottle and don't let it get dusty on your shelf!"
565,Peychauds,Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - 10 oz,2016-01-18T14:58:07Z,,,,12 ounces,The best!,I love a good champagne cocktail and this brand of bitters is MUCH better than the bitters found at the grocery store.
566,Peychauds,Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - 10 oz,2016-01-18T14:58:07Z,,,,12 ounces,Great bitters.,"I needed this to make my new favorite cocktail, (sazeracs) and it is a great product. Hard to find but leave it to Amazon to come through once again. The service and shipping was very fast also."
567,Peychauds,Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - 10 oz,2016-01-18T14:58:07Z,,,,12 ounces,"Need some for Sazeracs, great in Manhattans","If you want to have a complete battery of bitters for mixing drinks at home or at a bar, you need:Orange BittersPeach BittersLemon BittersOld Fashioned (Angostura-type) BittersPeychaud's BittersJaegermeisterCampariUnicumYou can't get Peychaud's bitters anywhere else...nothing else compares. I think its one of the most versatile bitters there is. Is great as a digestif, too. I like it more than Underberg's as a digestif."
568,Peychauds,Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - 10 oz,2016-01-18T14:58:07Z,,,,12 ounces,Excellent for making a Sazerac,A must for a Sazerac.-3 oz rye whiskey-3/4 oz simple syrup-Peychaud bitters to taste-absinthe or absinthe substitute-Lemon twist for garnish
569,Peychauds,Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - 10 oz,2016-01-18T14:58:07Z,,,,12 ounces,"Great product, but it may not be the one you are looking for","If you are looking for bitters for an old fashioned, manhattan, or any other drink that simply says bitters in the recipe, this is probably not what you want. Peychauds bitters taste very different than angostura bitters, as they have a character that tastes more like anise, absinthe, or black licorice. If that is indeed what you are looking for, for a drink such a sazerac, then you are in the right place. This bottle is 10oz, which is the larger size, and will indeed make many sazeracs."
570,Peychauds,Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - 10 oz,2016-01-18T14:58:07Z,,,,12 ounces,Taste of Old New Orleans,"Peychaud's Bitters is the defining ingredient in the classic New Orlean's cocktail known as the Sazerac, allegedly the first cocktail invented in the U.S., dating to the pre-Civil War period.As such, there's no substitute! It lends a mildly bitter taste and a sophisticated aroma to any beverage. In addition to mixing it for Sazeracs (check on line for various recipe versions), I add 7 - 10 drops to an iced glass of tonic or lemon-lime soda when I want a super-low-alcohol beverage with the taste of an alcohol cocktail. I find it soothes both the nerves and the digestive system."
571,Peychauds,Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - 10 oz,2016-01-18T14:58:07Z,,,,12 ounces,Sazerac. Anything else,"This is just one of those things you need if you really want a complete bar. They do have a pretty interesting and distinct taste, but it doesn't show up as potently as some other bitters in drinks.I bought the 10oz because it was cheaper per ounce after shipping. Note that Fee and Angostura usually sell their products in 4oz size. I don't think either of those companies make a Peychauds substitute.So what calls for Peychauds bitters besides a Sazerac Well, a tequila/absinthe sazerac for one (thanks to Absinthe Cocktails by Kate Simon). I'll keep looking for other uses..."
572,Peychauds,Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - 10 oz,2016-01-18T14:58:07Z,,,,12 ounces,Sazarac Bar at Home,"One doesn't need to travel to New Orleans for the perfect Sazarac. Make it with this ingredient, along with some good rye whiskey. This is also good in iced tea....mmmmm!"
573,Peychauds,Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - 10 oz,2016-01-18T14:58:07Z,,,,12 ounces,Must have,"Adds a nice flavor to manhattans. Lots of flavor. I use Peychauds with other bitters in ice water for a great 0 calorie drink. Vary the amounts of each for a well rounded drink. Peychauds can be used alone because it has the high, medium and base flavor notes. Try it."
574,Peychauds,Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - 10 oz,2015-12-14T10:55:36Z,,,,12 ounces,Adds more appeal to drinks,"Good stuff, adds interest to many otherwise ordinary cocktails. I'm still experimenting with this one, but so far I've used it in many drink recipes it seems to go especially well with sweet drinks."

After 3 weeks in the 2- 5 gallon primary's I kegged 5 gallons. The instructions for the vodka, spices and vanilla bean slurry were vague as to when to make the potion and how to store it. I mixed mine on brew day and it sat in the fridge while the beer fermented. It turned into a snot ball. I sanitized a mason jar and took half the ten gallons worth of potion mixture and while I kegged I added some beer to the jar and shook it vigorously to break up the snot ball. It worked for the most part. The first 3 beers came out a bit chunky but it cleared up. The potion made the beer taste a bit like cider. It's got a very upfront pumkin spice kick with hints of cinnamon. I'm not a big fan of these prominent flavors so I bottled the second 5 gallons without the potion.Overall the kits good. The abv came out at about 6.9 after adding an extra pound of dextrose.I expect he bottles to be a bit more to my liking."

The wine gums are smaller, harder, much paler in color, and all colors have this same wretchedly super-sweet after-taste that just keeps on giving me something that I definitely do not want.Why has Gustav begun shipping a different product with no advance notice to its loyal customers Well this is one former customer who is definitely no longer loyal! I'm stuck with 6.6kg. of these things and I'm seriously tempted to throw them in the garbage.Smarten up, Gustav's!

765,Brand Castle,"Gosling's Diet Ginger Beer, 12 fl oz",2014-11-07T09:22:38Z,,,,19.6 pounds,Goslings inferior diet ginger beer,"I received a case of Goslings diet ginger beer today. I had such high hopes for this product because this would be this first reasonably priced diet ginger beer that I could ship to my home that I have actually heard of (I had previously bought a case of Royalty diet ginger beer at Amazon, but I had never heard of the brand before buying it). I knew Goslings has a good reputation among Ginger Beers, so I had an expectation that I might have found a better diet ginger beer. Sadly, I was mistakenI tried this product in three blind taste tests with Royalty diet ginger beer as my alternative. In each of the three tests, I had a strong preference for Royalty. I found Goslings diet ginger beer to be overly sweet and syrupy, lacking in strong ginger flavor, and completely devoid of that spicy ginger bite that true ginger beer fans expect. Goslings diet ginger beer also has an unpleasant aftertaste that serves as a fitting exclamation point to this products mediocrity.I have had worse ginger beers. Saranac and Reeds come to mind. That said, Goslings diet ginger beer is simply an inferior product. When the price of this soda is similar to the diet ginger beers from Royalty or Barritts (for those who are lucky enough to have access to it), there is simply no reason to purchase Goslings diet ginger beer.Please note: I have used this product as a diet ginger beer, which I consumed plain or over ice. Although I highly doubt it, Goslings diet ginger beer may be the superior product for use in Dark n Stormy or Moscow Mule cocktails."

793,HomeBrewStuff,IRISH RED ALE Extract Beer Brewing recipe Homebrew kit Malt hops _ grains,2016-02-07T20:28:14Z,,,,,"Never judge a book by it's cover, because this Irish Red is amazing","I reached out in the comments to ask another member how this turned out, but to no avail. Despite my reservations, I ordered the kit and in a few days a USPS box arrived at my house. I opened the box and found that there was no fluff, no boxed kit, there were just ingredients (partial mash) and instructions. The 6 pound pouch of DME and other pouches had handwritten on it what it was and when to use them. Admittedly I wrinkled my nose and thought what the hell is this. Brew day came and went and I had no problems with making the wort, everything went smooth. Eight days go by and I find that the FG reading on the batch is where I want it to be so I bottled 51 bottles of beer to condition.Fast forward 7 days now. I opened one to test it out. This beer turned out really good. The dark red color of the batch hails to it being a true Irish Red. The beer has a slightly malty flavor with subtle hints of caramel notes to it. It's not overly hoppy (which I detest in beers). I'd purchase this again in a heartbeat.As a note to other people who may buy this, I enjoy darker, stouter beers. This might have better results if you thin the wort out by adding an extra 1/2 gallon or so of water. My beer came out darker than what is pictured (see below), some people strive for that true red coloring, and while this turned out red, it is a bit darker than traditional Irish Red's."

Clean ingredients, non gmo!","This really is the best root beer I have ever tasted! I usually buy it in our grocery store (about 4.50 per four pack), but it's sold out a lot! The ingredients are clean and natural, while most of the other root beers have junk ingredients, caramel color. I quit drinking traditional sodas years ago, because of the nasty ingredients and taste. Virgil's is absolute heaven in a root beer float. Virgil's root beer is micro brewed, smooth and creamy and I am addicted to it, I think. It's worth every penny.Description and ingredients:Virgils is a superb blend of spices and herbs gathered from the world over anise, licorice, vanilla (bourbon), cinnamon, clove, wintergreen, sweet birch, molasses, nutmeg, pimento berry oil, balsam oil and cassia oil.Ingredients: Purified carbonated water, unbleached cane sugar, caramelized unrefined cane sugar, citric acid, herbs and spices!

To start with, the root and bark of the Sassafras tree are no longer used, as they cause cancer and liver damage. The Sarsaparilla vine used to be used, but nowadays, most root beers use an artificial sarsaparilla flavor. Virgil's is naturally brewed from Sweet Birch, and a lot of other natural flavors. The licorice does not improve it, it contains too much sugar, and it is packaged in a breakable glass bottle. Processed food makers in general use far too much sugar and salt than is good for us. Virgil's RootBeer is natural and definitely different, but as a root beer, I can only give it three and a half Amazon stars, rounded off to four stars, as Amazon requires ratings to be in whole numbers.The Nutrition Facts, and Ingredients, as listed on the bottle:Nutrition Facts:Serving size: 12 oz.

I read reviews and ingredient lists until finding Dirty Sue. This product ain't cheap (it's salt water after all) but I was not disappointed. Like I said before, NO VINEGAR. I'm very pleased.

950,Fever-Tree,Fever Tree174 Tonic Water - 4pk / 6.8oz Bottle,2015-11-09T17:13:05Z,,,,0.208 lbs,Best Easily-Available Premium Tonic Water,"My wife and I just performed a taste test of three different tonic waters. We used Bombay Gin in all three to keep the variables to one--the tonic water. We used Schweppes Tonic Water, Q Tonic Water, and Fever-Tree Tonic Water. We thought the Fever-Tree was the best, with Q Tonic second, and Schweppes Tonic a distant third. The Schweppes had a cloying off-taste compared to the other two which we attributed to the high fructose corn syrup which sweetens it. Before we purchased the two premium tonic waters, we thought Schweppes was the best compared to Canada Dry and Seagram's. But the two premium tonic waters were both better. The Q Tonic (sweetened with agave nectar) was less sweet (and lower in calories) than the Fever-Tree (sweetened with cane sugar) and had a distinctly different taste, more subdued compared to Fever-Tree. Both had clean and crisp finishes that were very refreshing. We both thought Fever-Tree had more flavor, especially more citrus flavor, and we preferred it. We will be happy to finish the rest of the case of Q Tonic we bought, but we are going to purchase only Fever-Tree in the future. We prefer gin and tonics with Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray Gins. We tried Fever-Tree with Hendrick's Gin and it was good, better than Hendrick's in martinis, with which we prefer Bombay Sapphire."

I happen to prefer vodka tonics to gin and tonics, but the taste of Fever-Tree is so pure that it works with both equally well. My husband prefers G and T's, and he said it has changed the way he views tonic water. What started out as a search for a healthier alternative has actually ended up changing the way we see mixers. I love this tonic water and will be ordering more. With the free shipping, it's actually not much more expensive than Schweppes, especially when you consider that Schweppes goes flat so quickly in the huge liter bottle.

I asked for a ginger ale at the St. Regis in San Francisco and got this instead. What a pleasant surprise! The smell of ginger transformed me to another world. A world of sakura petals falling softly on verdant, rolling hills with a warm breeze and snow capped mountains in the background. I took a sip and little pebbles of joy started dancing in my mouth. And the fun didn't just go away like with your average drink. The taste lingers, prolonging the experience. This is a drink for parties, after-parties and after-after-parties. Or to be enjoyed alone.There's a scripture that describes my reaction to this drink. And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit.

We even had neighbors taste test with us, and they agreed that something was definitely very odd in the ones that we had just received, which all expired 7/14.One of these neighbors owns a home nearby, and as a bartender, knows the Fever Tree mixers well.

First, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to review my Cocktail Artist Premium Manhattan Mix. I am totally humbled and very passionate about bringing you this remarkable product. What I've done is take out the guess work for making an exceptional Manhattan at home. Just use 2 parts whiskey and 1 part CA Manhattan Mix, stir with ice and enjoy...yes it's that easy! By being able to create a unique product that is made with all natural ingredients and pure cane sugar you get a smooth, well balanced cocktail that doesn't have any artificial flavors or aftertaste. Try my Manhattan Mix with other Cocktail Artist essential bar ingredients, to easily create a variety of amazing drinks. Use it with our Cocktail Artist lemon juice to make the perfect Whiskey Sour or with our CA Mint Syrup for an amazing Mint Julip. If your not a big fan Whiskey, you can use this with other spirits. Mix tequila with CA Manhattan mix and our premium lime juice for a fine Margarita. Or make a Dark and Stormy using lite rum, CA Manhattan Mix, CA Mule Mix and top with club soda. Another favorite of mine is the Nigroni with Gin, CA Manhattan Mix, Campari and an orange twist. I urge you guys to exparament and see what you can create. Make the glass your canvas, mix it like you mean it. Robert."

I feel I will be expressing this to everyone I meet until the bitter end of my life. This mix... this powerful concoction of pure ecstasy ... is unbelievably awesome and will likely turn me into a raging alcoholic passed out in a gutter occasionally coming to the surface to scream I need more as monkeys and degenerate courtesans frolic in my bodily fluids streaming from both ends. It's that freaking good folks... buy it... buy cases of it... snort it, drink it, shoot it, whatever you do ... just try it! Once you do you'll be on here leaving another depraved review... hopefully three times more twisted than mine! God Speed. God Speed."

Further, I knew that I would soon host several liquor pros, including those that would size-up my novice bartending abilities. Enter the Cocktail Artist Essential Bar Ingredients Premium Manhattan Mix. Making my pre-shindig trip to Walmart, I circled the aisles looking for something that could help me out. I came across a bottle of this liquid magic which allowed me to craft top-notch Manhattans. To this day, I still am asked by party patrons what was my secret recipe, go figure!

Yes, gas models are more powerful, but they're more expensive and you need to maintain them. First off - the build quality. Seems rugged. Metal couplings for hoses (vs plastic for my dad's old one). How well it does: Concrete was cleaned! The big circle washer does an OK job, but the turbo washer really gets it done (see photo). The big circle washer would be good for maintaining, not for a deep clean. Also had no issues cleaning my grill from 2 years of grease. Overall with a 2 year warranty I'm pretty happy with this!"

The right tequila can make a noticeable difference when mixing up a margarita, but the right mixer is important as well. And one of the best mixers available is Power Mahoney Margarita.I just got to know Powell Mahoney recently and I have been singing its praises ever since. This mix is every bit as delicious as the others in the Powell Mahoney lineup thanks in no small part to the all- natural ingredients used in the process. Have you taken a good look at the ingredients used in other mixers They're enough to make even the most tolerant person cringe. Even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and I can think of many mixed drinks that I could barely finish due to a less-than-pleasant mixer base.With Powell Mahnoey Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour. Pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself. You will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila. The taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non- alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added.Margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient. With Powell Mahoney Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural, fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink. Buy a bottle from this Vermont- based company and fall in love with your margarita, all over again."

It was part of a gift for my boyfriend for his new bar set, the something extra after the staples of Regan's, Angostura, and Peychauds, and the smallest and most expensive bottle of the group. It has been worth every penny -- complex, flavorful, rich, not overly sweet, a real winner. The Bittermens website has some wonderful recipes, but we have been most enjoying it so far with a large rock, 2 shots, a dash of Regan's, 7 drops or so of this one and a splash each of lemon and soda water."

I would say there is a strong nutmeg note here which can put some folks off, but I'm a huge fan personally. It's tough to find bitters that work in tiki drinks beyond Angostura, so this is a great addition to the bar for people that make a lot of tropical themed cocktails."

I like that taste, having done some experiments based on the Parsons book, and find it uncommon among the commercial bitters I've tried.But, I have to say, I still prefer my own walnut-based flavors. This comes on strong with the central flavor and enticing bitterness, but lacks the secondary and tertiary notes that make a flavor memorable. So, it's good. If I didn't make my own, very good - it would be a regular on my shelf. Recommended, unless you make your own.-- wiredweirdPS: I'm not a fan of dropper bottles, and this comes with a medicine dropper.

Whether or not you like the taste of the product (I was pleased enough), the 4-inch plastic dropper rod, while very handy for adding drops of the bitters to one's drink in a measured manner, is made from an extremely foul source.Discovered this after having finished off a bottle of Bittermen's Grapefruit Bitters and leaving it on the shelf for a month, then opened up the bottle to add some gin and absorb the remains of the bitters to the quite empty bottle. An extremely foul toxic smell emerged immediately investigating, I found it to unmistakably be the plastic dropper rod attached to the bottle cap. While immersed in the strong-smelling and -tasting bitters solution, it's disguised. When not, well, ... it is just revolting. Try it see for yourself.No one should be ingesting any substance steeped in this material. Bittermen's, you really gotta clean up your act with that dropper rod."

If the thought of drinking a bottle of vinegar sounds appealing to you, then you may enjoy this. If it doesn't, then you do NOT want these.

I would say there is a strong nutmeg note here which can put some folks off, but I'm a huge fan personally. It's tough to find bitters that work in tiki drinks beyond Angostura, so this is a great addition to the bar for people that make a lot of tropical themed cocktails."

It was part of a gift for my boyfriend for his new bar set, the something extra after the staples of Regan's, Angostura, and Peychauds, and the smallest and most expensive bottle of the group. It has been worth every penny -- complex, flavorful, rich, not overly sweet, a real winner.

Hubby suggested trying home. I was so happy to find this product my Walmart Supercenter! First, it's taste is great. Not much difference in taste from Mr. and Mrs. T's, which is slightly higher in price. Prior to purchasing Walmart, wasn't aware they carried mixers - foolish on my part - duh, they have everything! I was paying like 4.50 to 5.00 per bottle other stores. At Walmart, believe it or not, it is...........2.88!!!!!!! So I stocked up bought 3 bottles. They also have it in a lite version......sugar-free and I thought that would be great......not so. I drink suger-free pop, but this doesn't taste as good in the sugar-free version. So tomorrow I am going to exchange 2 of the bottles for the regular type. Hey, a few carbs here and there.....oh well! Love Walmart!

Hubby suggested trying @ home. I was so happy to find this product @ my Walmart Supercenter! First, it's taste is great. Not much difference in taste from Mr. and Mrs. T's, which is slightly higher in price. Prior to purchasing @ Walmart, [wasn't aware they carried mixers - foolish on my part - duh, they have everything!] I was paying like $4.50 to $5.00 per bottle @ other stores. At Walmart, believe it or not, it is...........$2.88!!!!!!! So I stocked up & bought 3 bottles. They also have it in a ""lite"" version......sugar-free and I thought that would be great......not so. I drink suger-free pop, but this doesn't taste as good in the sugar-free version. So tomorrow I am going to exchange 2 of the bottles for the regular type. Hey, a few carbs here and there.....oh well! Love Walmart! I especially love that you have the ability to check the availability of the product online before treking out, especially since the mixer is pretty much only sold @ the Supercenters, and we have 4 within a 20 mile radius......but only one has it!"

But clear liquor products (vodka, gin, white rum, and silver tequila) contain less toxic wood solute byproducts (tannins and formaldehydes) than heavily-aged 'dark' liquors. Science aside, Sauza Signature Silver is a splendid treat and delightful to sip. The clean, crisp agave taste that makes tequila so special is front-and-center without the woody heaviness of darker tequilas. Tequila is an acquired taste, and Sauza Signature Blue is a taste worth acquiring...a taste to be savored."

Nonetheless, I expect my experience with this brand and product is applicable. I bought 2 dozen of the various types -- flaky butter, reduced fat, and standard -- and all had the same problems to some degree. Although I was using the rolls up to 3 weeks prior to the 30JUN13 expiration date on the end-cap of the packages, the dough in many packages was so dry (old poorly stored) that it would stick to the packaging. And it was impossible to unroll the dough.. I had to pry off chunks ... and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some Frankenrolls. The other reviews say the SAME THING ... going back as far as 2009. And now I'm extending that same complaint to mid-2013. Why has Walmart continued to deal with the same supplier despite the same problem for AT LEAST 4 years My recommendation: Spend the extra 24 cents (or whatever) on the real thing: Pillsbury crescent rolls."

I had to bang it on the counter to open, and when it did, it was more of a BANG than a pop, and dough shot out all over the place. The dough that was salvageable, in no way resembled a crescent. I had to form it into triangles by myself, of course the dough was so sticky that it was nearly impossible. The taste of the finished rolls did however taste the same as name brand rolls, but the measly few cents saved to purchase the great value brand was not worth the extra work, and mess to purchase.

It was useless and had to be thrown away. It was a ball of sticky, gooey, unshapable dough. Into the trash it went and my husband ran out to get another brand. We had one pack left that I just used this morning straight out of the fridge and the rolls were just as good as the name brand. My little ones even had seconds.

At 4 weeks I stabilized and put in the clarifiers. As always, I tasted the wine to establish dryness and flavor at the 4 week mark. From my experience, I believe this will be one of my better Merlots. The oak added the dryness I was looking for, the elderberries gave it a nice fruity flavor and the base Merlot had a nice all around wine flavor. I expect to bottle and age this for no less than 6 months, at which time I believe it will be a very good tasting wine.

I havent done a lot of searching for different mix and am pretty sure that this one is a good bet. I like my margaritas on the rocks and this mix seems to really do the trick as far as flavor. The reason I had even picked up a bottle to try is because the local golf course uses this to mix their margaritas and so I thought it would be a good start for me. I didnt have to search long to find it and I actually paid a decent price for it. The container is easy to pour out of and is sturdy. I use Jose Cuervo to mix my margaritas, although I think any tequila would work. I dont shake mine yet because I still need to buy a shaker but I do give them a good mix. The overall taste of the mix is sweet and tart, but not overly powerful on those to senses. I recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as I did so, and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day. I will definitely be purchasing more of this mix in the near future and maybe adding different fruit flavors to it to punch it up a notch, but dont get me wrong the flavor out of the bottle is very good."

I would also note that I only use it for reds and the temperature doesn't fluctuate. Got my money's worth on this product."

1510,Kalamera,Kalamera 12 Bottle Single Zone Freestanding Wine Cooler,2015-12-01T02:38:03Z,,,,,Greattt BUT,"It looks great. A real attention piece in our kitchen. Tons of space. I removed the lower rack and have some sodas, other various drinks from time to time.... my only and bigest issue with this is that I can never get the temperature down past 51. If that's okay for you, this is a great cooler. My wife likes her wine cold and in an ideal situation temp would be 41-44 degrees. This is not capable of that no matter how long you leave it on. One more thing, everytime you open the door even if it's for a matter of seconds you will see a temperature rise of about 3 degrees. Foolishness. Great for the price but that's it."
1511,Kalamera,Kalamera 12 Bottle Single Zone Freestanding Wine Cooler,2015-12-01T02:38:03Z,,,,,Worth the low price.,Didn't have any reviews when I bought it so I just paid the extra cash for the Assurion insurance. I really like this thing. Sleep and stylish looks really good in my living room for my expensive beer collection that I wanted to cellar. I don't think you can cellar anything where I live in SoCal so this helped out a lot. On the lower levels of the temp range the fan is pretty loud. If you can handle that then you will be OK.
1512,Kalamera,Kalamera 12 Bottle Single Zone Freestanding Wine Cooler,2015-12-01T02:38:03Z,,,,,Two Stars,Never gets cold enough.
1513,Kalamera,Kalamera 12 Bottle Single Zone Freestanding Wine Cooler,2015-12-01T02:38:03Z,,,,,So far so good,"We received the unit a few days ago. So far it is as promised. Noise level outside the unit is acceptable--slightly less than your average refrigerator, around 40db in the surrounding area. Fine for a common area of the home. It cooled our wine down from 77 to 55 degrees pretty quickly. We have tried out a couple of thermo-electric units that seems to run for hours upon hours, never quite reaching the desired temperature--so we decided to go with a compressor based refrigerator that has more power and therefore, won't have to run as many hours (and require service/repair as quickly). The cooler looks great as shown. The refrigerant is R600--it is nontoxic--which is a big plus. When it is running, the top of the unit gets hot--so don't put any candles on it! We removed the second-to-last shelf (towards the bottom) to comfortably accommodate our different-sized bottles. We currently have 30 bottles in there, and could fit comfortably 5-7 more (Syrah, Grenache and Burgundy bottles take up more space than standard Bordeaux-type bottles). It is hard to find a good quality, long-lasting wine refrigerator--after much research--hopefully we have found the best one. Time will tell. Finally, I would give five stars for this cooler, however the seller was extremely slow to respond to my product inquiries and is unclear as to the terms of warranty (other companies have stated one year for cooler plus 3 years for compressor, for instance). Hopefully we won't have any problems in the future, in which case I suppose we would have to lean on Amazon to remedy the situation."
1514,Kalamera,Kalamera 12 Bottle Single Zone Freestanding Wine Cooler,2015-12-01T02:38:03Z,,,,,Love this Wine Cellar,"Excellent Wine Cellar, doesn't take up much space. It's quiet when running and seems to maintain the temperature you set it. This is only the case if you don't have a power outage in your area. It will default to 66 degrees when the power returns."

1516,Kalamera,Kalamera 12 Bottle Single Zone Freestanding Wine Cooler,2015-12-01T02:38:03Z,,,,,otherwise it seems to be working pretty well.,"Didn't get 5 stars because it doesn't spare any room for bottles that are a little longer. They should redesign for a little extra room, otherwise it seems to be working pretty well."
1517,Kalamera,Kalamera 12 Bottle Single Zone Freestanding Wine Cooler,2015-12-01T02:38:03Z,,,,,very happy so far,"We received this two days ago in perfect condition. so far I am very satisfied. The unit looks great, operates fairly quietly, and is maintaining a perfect 55 degrees for our good reds. i only have 55 bottles in it so I have not tested the full capacity. the only con so far is that we have a few fatter than normal bottles that did not fit on certain shelves and some taller bottles that did not fit on the bottom shelves because of the compressor behind. But these are minor annoyances."
1518,Kalamera,Kalamera 12 Bottle Single Zone Freestanding Wine Cooler,2015-12-01T02:38:03Z,,,,,Met expectations,Slightly noisier than I'd prefer but quiet enough to have just outside a bedroom.

I like Coco LoPez but it is in a can which makes it difficult to use just a couple of tablespoons. I add it to my fruit smoothies and gives them just that touch of sweetness and coconut flavoring to make them pop. Right now I am using it with an orange chicken stir fry. My problem is that I have been looking for it for about a month and cannot find it at the Walmart stores where I bought it originally. While this is a great product I really don't want to buy a case of it. However, if that is the only way I can get it I may have no other choice. Please start stocking this in the stores."
1567,COCO REAL,"Coco Real Cream Of Coconut, 21 oz ()",2017-09-06T04:49:34Z,TRUE,25,5,,This makes a great syrup for pancakes and waffles!,"I was searching for coconut syrup at my Walmart one day, and I found this Coco Real in the mixed drinks section. While I don't drink alcoholic drinks, I do enjoy mocktails occasionally, so I figured if it wouldn't work for pancakes, then I could make Pina/Colada Mocktails out of it and some pineapple juice. I shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well, then used it on my hot pancakes at home. It was sooooo good. I usually only use pure maple syrup on them, but wanted some coconut syrup. This really filled that need so well. It was so delicious that I do believe I wouldn't even need to use butter on my pancakes when I use Coco Real as my syrup. It's not been easy to find locally for some reason, not even at the Walmart where I found it once. I bought the last two bottles Walmart had that day. It would be very nice if Walmart.com would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time. I used one of those two bottles up pretty fast, but since I can't find it anymore, I am saving my remaining bottle for when I will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup. Torani also makes a good sugar-free coconut syrup that I would like for Walmart.com to keep in stock regularly, as well as their sugar-free Watermelon syrup. In the hot summertime, Torani sugar-free Watermelon syrup makes such refreshing drinks, and it goes well with Mexican food, which I really enjoy. It's the next best thing to liquefying cubes of real watermelon in my blender and chilled."

My wife and I enjoyed it. Now the original is made with high fructose cord syrup and no loger even tastes like it has a tomato juice base. I will no longer purchase this bastardized concoction.
1569,Mott's Inc.,"Mr _ Mrs T Original Bloody Mary Mix, 5.5 fl oz",2017-01-14T19:38:15Z,,,,,Very good alone!,"I actually like this alone, without any vodka! Tomato juice is good, but I love the spiciness of this mix even better. The cans make it portable (I carry them as a snack at work), and although I'm disappointed that Mr. Mrs. T has apparently discontinued the 11.5 oz size I used to buy, this size works for me, too."
1570,Mott's Inc.,"Mr _ Mrs T Original Bloody Mary Mix, 5.5 fl oz",2017-01-14T19:38:15Z,,,,,Great taste and reasonable size,I keep these on hand for my aging mother in assisted living as she likes a little spice in her snacks. These taste very good and are small enough for a quick snack between meals. I also use them in soups and stews to enrich the broth. They even make a great quick cup of soup by themselves when microwaved and topped with some grated cheese. Very nice product.
1571,Mott's Inc.,"Mr _ Mrs T Original Bloody Mary Mix, 5.5 fl oz",2017-01-14T19:38:15Z,,,,,Better than the bottle,"I developed an appreciation for this drink during my days of frequent airline travel. I prefer to drink them straight (without booze). As a result, I started buying bottles of the mix at the grocery store--because finding this by the can in the real world is impossible. IMPOSSIBLE. Unfortunately, when you buy this by the bottle something happens. The first glass tastes exactly as you expected. But once you open the bottle, if you don't drink the contents within 24-36 hours the taste turns. Keeping a stock of cans in the house, therefore, is essential. I live in a major metropolitan area and I can't find these cans in any store. Not grocery stores (including mom pop, big chains, high-end small chains, etc), not liquor stores (including corner stores or BevMo). Enter Amazon. I'm very grateful I can buy this by the can here on the interwebs. I personally prefer the smaller-size cans to the 11.5 ounce. Make sure to buy enough to qualify for super saver shipping."

Truth is, I drink this because it's an extremely tasty Tomato Juice Cocktail! No alcohol necessary. Much tastier than V-8. Try it! You could even add alcohol, if it pleases you."
1575,Mott's Inc.,"Mr _ Mrs T Original Bloody Mary Mix, 5.5 fl oz",2017-01-14T19:38:15Z,,,,,Very Good Bloody Mary Mix - Highly Recommended!,"Mr Mrs T's Bloody Mary Mix is our favorite off-the-shelf Bloody Mary mix and these 5.5oz cans are very convenient. We use the less expensive larger bottles if we know our guests will be having Bloody Marys but like these cans for single servings since the larger bottles need to be refrigerated after being opened.We add a little more than 1oz of Vodka (your taste may vary) and find that it really doesn't need anything else for most people. It is just spicy enough for my wife, but I put an extra shot of Tabasco Sauce in mine and my mother cuts hers with a little tomato juice to dilute the heat a little. These are also good straight (without any spirits added) and as substitute for tomato juice in cooking (particularly vegetable stock) to add an extra zing to your dishes.The 24 can case is a good value (especially if you have Prime or qualify for free Super Saver shipping) since we could only find them in smaller packs locally and at a much higher price per can.Highly Recommended!CFH"

This is not to say that it is better different cocktails work better with the other two. I find that a dash of these ones turns an otherwise decent sidecar into an incredible one."

Intense and very potent, it will give your Manhattan or Old Fashioned a real kick in the pants. I want to experiment using it with Crepes Suzette or Grand Marnier cakes - it should intensify and enhance quite well. In addition: If you have not tried Fee Brother's Old Fashion Aromatic Bitters or Peychaud's Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - then you have not experienced what bitters can do for your cocktails - or vanilla ice cream - for that matter! I am afraid that the old stand-by Angostura just doesn't compare - and I like Angostura very much!"

1583,Regan's,Regan's Orange Bitters No. 6 - 5 oz Bottle,2017-01-14T19:38:14Z,,,,9.6 ounces,Your Secret Ingredient,"Bitters are making a resurgence these days and I know many bars (at least here in NYC) are bringing back a properly made cocktail. Looking at old cocktail books from the 20s, 30s, and 40s I found that bitters were a key ingredient in many classic cocktails. After doing extensive research I learned that Regan's made some of the best, if not the best, orange bitters (go to their website and read the story behind this product). Your other choices are Fee Brothers and Angostura. Regan's however gets, and in my opinion, deserves top billing when it comes to orange bitters. These bitters are great in a variety of drinks and I usually put two dashes in my Old Raj martinis. Although you don't get a strong orange flavor per se you do notice that these bitters subtly enhance the complexity of the drink. Try these and you won't be disappointed. Go to Regan's website to find literally hundreds of drink recipes that use their bitters. You'll be inspired to make something more than a boring vodka tonic or gin martini."
1584,Angostura,"Angostura Orange Bitters, 4 fl oz, ()",2017-01-14T19:39:03Z,,,,9.6 ounces,Not ready for prime time,"I have been working my way back to classic cocktail recipes ever since reading David Wondrich's book Imbibe! on the great Professor Jerry Thomas and his cocktail recipes and techniques. A wealth of information there and a beginning of a long journey to try to recreate the cocktail prior to the great disaster called Prohibition. As a martini drinker, I naturally wanted to explore the tastes of the original drink so I began with orange bitters. In my market there were no retailers who carried orange bitters, so I had to rely on the ever more expensive places that will ship the stuff to your door. I started with Fee Brothers orange bitters and then tried the Peychaud version of Gary Regan's orange bitters (no. 6). Finally about 3 months ago a local liquor and wine store chain started stocking the new Angostura orange bitters. Thinking it would be easier and less expensive to support a local merchant and also wanting to try the bitters, I picked up a bottle. I was a little taken aback when I saw the retail price, 11 versus 7 for Fee Brothers and 6 for Regan's. I decided to try it anyway.Upon opening the bottle I realized that the bottle itself was orange colored and the internal contents were virtually colorless. Having made many fruit and peel extractions for liqueurs, I was very suspicious. Forging on I sniffed the aroma from the open bottle. The first smell is definitely orange, with an underlying clove aroma and something cloying behind those aromas that does not seem to work well. In the drink the orange flavor is good and the bitterness that is necessary in a quality bitter is apparent. But it seems to me that it is quickly overwhelmed by something like a passion fruit flavor that definitely does not belong in a martini. I would consider using this product in drinks that have some fruit juice and will experiment some with it. I think wit would compliment a splash of pineapple juice in a drink like the Cobalt, but I would not use it in a martini."
1585,Angostura,"Angostura Orange Bitters, 4 fl oz, ()",2017-01-14T19:39:03Z,,,,9.6 ounces,An orange bitters worthy of the Angostura name,"I think it's fair to say that Angostura's ubiquitous aromatic bitters are the standard against which all other aromatic bitters are judged. And with the release of Angostura's orange bitters, I believe that the company has created a new standard in that area as well.These bitters are zesty, sharp, and deliver a gigantic orange punch. I am a huge fan of Regan's orange bitters, but where those go off into a deeper, spicier direction, Angostura's offering stays laser focused on orange, orange, and more orange. Brilliant. I highly recommend these bitters for anyone who needs a bit more orange accent in your cocktails -- and really, who doesn't"
1586,Angostura,"Angostura Orange Bitters, 4 fl oz, ()",2017-01-14T19:39:03Z,,,,9.6 ounces,A Dash of Brilliance from Angostura,"Angostura has been a brand name well-known to my family for generations. As a child, I remember my grandfather and keeping a bottle around. These days, I always have one on hand and so do most of my friends. Recently my local grocery store stopped carrying Angostura regularly so I looked online for it (as almost everything is available online these days) and much to my surprise it was available in original and orange flavor! I haven't yet tried any other brands or flavors of bitters, but I do know that I thoroughly enjoy Angostura orange bitters and will be buying another bottle. In fact, I may have been converted to orange. I find it versatile in that its great for cocktails, non-alcoholic mixers, and flavoring carbonated water such as club soda and seltzer. Like the original, the more you add, the more pronounced the flavor can be so the flavor can range from a delicate hint to bold."
1587,Angostura,"Angostura Orange Bitters, 4 fl oz, ()",2017-01-14T19:39:03Z,,,,9.6 ounces,Nice product but price a head scratcher,"Angostura Orange Bitters is now the third product in a tiny little product niche that includes long-standing stalwart Fee Brother's and Regan's No. 6. Since the traditional Angostura Bitters (essential ingredient in Manhattan and Pegu Club cocktails) is an institution that has extremely wide distribution, this product is piggybacking off the older product's brand recognition and iconic status. So why does this product cost 9.95 for 4 oz. when Regan's No. 6 costs 6.26 for 5 oz. and Fee Brothers costs 6.99 for 5 oz. The answer is that price probably doesn't matter if you've got the distribution.

You can peel off the liner but it's a nuisance. Also, I use a Sizzix Big Kick to flatten. At first they were going complete flat and distorted into ovals. After several frustrating attempts, I realized I was using an extra shim from a previous project. If you use just the base plate and the 2 cutting plates, they will turn out perfectly. Also, they cut deep and will stick' to the cutting plate but will pop out very easily.

It worked very well and didn't have a yeasty flavor at all. It can be a little slow to start, but that is likely because I wasn't using it for the intended purpose. If you're looking for a long-lasting, simple, affordable yeast for white wines of any type, this will keep you happy.It is worth noting that each packet is enough for 5 gallons worth of wine so long as you give it sufficient time to ferment."
1612,Home Brew Ohio,Cote des Blancs Wine Yeast -s,2015-08-22T07:46:13Z,,,,,yeast,"A wonderful yeast for making delicious and strong hard cider. Feed your yeast good, use raw sugar. Add yeast at room temp."
1613,Home Brew Ohio,Cote des Blancs Wine Yeast -s,2015-08-22T07:46:13Z,,,,,"Perfect for your lighter wines, ciders","Nice fresh yeast. This brand has always performed exceptionally, and we have never had a dud. It doesn't impart harsh yeasty flavors to your fermentables. We have used this for wine and mead, holds up to higher alcohol, we don't even prime it, we just pitch and the airlocks are bubbling merrily away in a few hours."
1614,Home Brew Ohio,Cote des Blancs Wine Yeast -s,2015-08-22T07:46:13Z,,,,,good,Arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. Made honey mead over the fall. Works as directed. Will see results in the spring.

1619,Home Brew Ohio,Cote des Blancs Wine Yeast -s,2017-01-14T19:38:15Z,,,,,Failed,Attempted twice to get this to make wine and it failed. It did not ferment at all. Perhaps it was a bad batch of yeast. ()
1620,Home Brew Ohio,Cote des Blancs Wine Yeast -s,2017-01-14T19:38:15Z,,,,,Highly recommend,"I love this it has become my go to for white, and blush brews. There is virtually no foam at all, just a little bubbling. I used this with pear, the final product was so wonderfully aromatic, and the taste was superb. It made you just want to drink glass after glass of it. There was a nice level of alcohol as well, about 9-10. However, I made 6 gallons and only used one package. The instructions say one package will do up to 5 gallons so if I had used two I would probably have gotten a higher alcohol percentage. Nevertheless, even with one package it was wonderful."
1621,Alstertor,"Alstertor Mustard Mug, 8.45 Ounce",2015-11-16T06:49:32Z,,,,1.2 pounds,Mildly spicy mustard,"This mustard came as a Christmas stocking stuffer. I've tried various spicy mustards over the years in hope I would find the perfect mustard. Some have been really good, some not quite so good. And to some extent what I want depends on what sort of mood I'm in and what I'm putting the mustard on. I have come to really like this Alstertor mustard. It has a pleasant taste without being overwhelming. Although I consider it a fairly mild mustard, it is stronger (and nicer) than a typical dijon mustard. At the same time it doesn't have the astringency of certain mustards that heavily emphasize the horseradish. I have found it to be a great complement to large soft pretzels. It also works pretty well with a not overly spiced sausage as well. And I like the little mug. As a home brewer I've often thought it would be nice to have a mug like this when I wanted to sample my beer."
1622,Alstertor,"Alstertor Mustard Mug, 8.45 Ounce",2015-11-16T06:49:32Z,,,,1.2 pounds,Great German mustard,This is my favorite German mustard! It goes well with everything. The only reason it is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the price. The exact same product can be purchased at World Market for nearly half the price.
1623,Alstertor,"Alstertor Mustard Mug, 8.45 Ounce",2015-11-16T06:49:32Z,,,,1.2 pounds,Nothing special,"I am glad if people like this mustard - I am from Germany and this is one of the cheapest mustards and really not that good - in Germany it costs about one Euro or less, it is a cheap mustard.... don't buy it for the glass, it's really small and cheap, this mustard is some generic brand, not from one of the good old German famous German companies (Kuehne, Thomy etc.)."
1624,Alstertor,"Alstertor Mustard Mug, 8.45 Ounce",2015-11-16T06:49:32Z,,,,1.2 pounds,One of the best,I currently have nine different mustards in my house.

1625,Alstertor,"Alstertor Mustard Mug, 8.45 Ounce",2015-11-16T06:49:32Z,,,,1.2 pounds,"Good mustard, but overpriced!","I purchased this mustard based on the reviews. I am not disappointed in the taste however, I am in the packaging and the price. First, the tape used to hold the lid down was not as pictured nor was it very secure. The date code on the side of the lid is worn off where I cannot read the month or day...only the year, which is 2013. The price at 8.49 is about 5-6 too high. I have found it at MyBrands, which is the importer's site for public sale, at 2.25 and elsewhere for 3 and up. I think the 8.49 price has the free shipping built in. I will be ordering this mustard again, but not through Atlantic Quality here on Amazon. Otherwise, very good mustard."

If I don't use chap stick every day my lips dry out to the point that they crack and bleed.

I can put it on twice a day (before work and before bed) and my lips are fine sometimes I can even get do fine using it just once a day if the weather isn't harsh. If its really cold or dry I still only need to use chap stick mid-day once when I use the carmex morning and night, which is a vast improvement. I love it. Added bonus the jar is my favorite color."

But what I was upset about was that, even though it looks like the same jar, if you look underneath, the indentation goes up so far, that it is about half of what you used to get. I have an old glass jar, and compared to the new plastic one, the indentation on the bottom is at least half way up!

In the vast world we all live in today, we are often overwhelmed by the HUGE number of choices we are faced with every day, even when it comes to something as simple as which chap stick we want to purchase.

I've had dry and chapped lips for so long and I've tried everything: Blistex, EOS, Chapsticks, Lucas' PawPaw and even medicated lip ointments. I recently picked up a Carmex over an 'instinctual urge' and I don't think I've ever looked back since. Carmex does wonders for my lips. They're so smooth and soft now - even my boyfriend has commented on them! The consistency is just right, not too thin and not too thick. I've found with Lucas' Pawpaw, it's only good for chapped lips and Blistex and EOS only gives me a thin layer of lip balm. I like to apply lip balm before I sleep because my room sits at a cool 11 degrees celsius. I find that because of the consistency, Carmex really absorbs and heals your lips while you sleep. Blistex leaves a thin coating on my lips when I wake up whilst pawpaw doesn't absorb very well either and sometimes dries out my lips even more. I recommend this little tub of goodness to everyone and anyone who is looking for a great lip balm or lip remedy. I've only needed to apply it 3-4 times daily, and I have extremely dry and chapped lips from my medication and it works wonders for me. I really love my little tub of Carmex and it's by far one of the best lip remedies I've picked up - at such an affordable price as well!"

Spending the afternoon w/ my grandmother, she stopped at a local pharmacy to buy me a tube of ChapStick the pharmacist helping her suggested that we try a new aid handed her a little yellow tin tub of Carmex suggested we try it! I used it non-stop for the next few days, and AMAZED my whole family w/ how well FAST Carmex did the job!!!!! I have used NOTHING ELSE ever since! My lips belong SOLELY to Carmex!!!!! MANY Thanks Carmex!"
2571,Carmex,"Carmex Lip Balm Original Jar - 12 PK, 12.",2017-09-23T02:53:08Z,TRUE,,5,,MAKES THE WORLD'S SOFTEST LIPS!!!,"I have been an avid user of Carmex in the pot for the last 40 years!! I was living in Wisconsin when I started using this product in high school in the 70's. I then moved to Florida and they did NOT have Carmex in the state of Florida. I was distraught and had to have my mother send me shipments of carmex so I could survive. I have a pot of carmex in every room of my house, my car, my purses -- EVERYWHERE!!! I have tried all of the other lip products out there and the ONLY one I find absolutely reliable everytime is Carmex. My lips have stayed so soft for so many years and I never have chapped lips. Carmex is the best thing since sliced bread!"

There are not many products out there, that I have found, that work consistently and do exactly what they claim to do, but this one does. At the first hint of a cold sore, I grab the Carmex as quickly as I can. and apply it. It stops the cold sore from progressing and heals what is trying to pop out. If I can't find my little jar, I panic and hurry to the store to buy another one. (No one wants to go around with an ugly cold sore!) I've always thought it amazing that a product that works so well, would be so affordable!"

The orange flavor liquid lip conditioning tube has worked wonders for me these days, I also used the original jar but right now I don't remember where I put it so I haven't used it. From what I remember it has a nice refreshing scent and also calms your lips from burning due to the extreme dryness."

A few days ago, a friend and I went to Garden of the Gods and I failed to bring chapstick. The result was me linking my lips WAY too much and I suffered tremendously the next day. My lips were on fire. The day after that, my lips were SO severely chapeed, I didn't even want to go to work. Well, of course I went, and I bought this little miracle in a jar. Within just a few hours, my lips were 80 better. Still chapped as they needed to heal but I was so shocked at how quickly Carmex soothed my lips. Amazing. I love it."

I decided to buy it, the jar was so interesting, the price was good, too, but I must admit, my expectations weren't very high. I have a lot of lip balms, and none of them really works. And then... such a big surprise! The menthol, the camphor... these aren't very usual for lip balms, but they did a good job with my lips, together with the other ingredients. It became my favourite balm in the world! I would be sooo happy to try the other products, but, unfortunately, it's impossible to buy these from here, and to bring them from the USA it's too expensive."

This is the only lip balm that doesnt irritate my lips. other lip balms and glosses leave my lips numb and itchy, this doesn't. its like a miracle in a jar. i never get cold sores, but i use this like an everyday lip balm. it is wonderful. if you like wearing lipstick, and sometimes have those annoying dry peeling lips, put some of this on your lips while your getting ready, then wipe it of and apply lipstick. i like that its not oily greasy like the blistex in the jar. carmex has the perfect texture. the smell is like the original chapstick smell. lol it kind of reminds me of the smell of a new baby doll's skin. kind of powdery in a way, but i like it. it's so cheap. only 99 cents at my walmart. so worth buying. you wont be disappointed. you can also use it on dry hands as well. it's long lasting too."

I in turn introduced it to my husband, he cannot do without it. Due to his addiction we probably keep 10 -15 jars stashed around the house and in the cars. One on each side of the bed, one in the bathroom, one in each of our cars. There is always at least 1 in the laundry room (freshly laundered) 2-3 in his desk drawer and a couple of brand new ones, just in case. My only disappointment was the day I went to buy an new jar and the package felt different... My beloved jar was now plastic. My little wonderfully feeling porcelain (I believe) jar was gone, I have to admit, that month I searched for my beloved jar in every store I went, in the hopes that they had not sold out of them, only to be replaced by the new plastic jar. I don't know about anyone else, but I would gladly pay an uncharge to have my beloved and true Classic Original Jar back once again."

When I was a teen there would always be a little jar in my Christmas stocking along with a tube now that I wanted to wear lip gloss. I never went to lip gloss, just my Carmex. As my own daughters came I would put a little Carmex on their lips before they left the house too...they got a little tub in their Christmas stockings. Now I have granddaughters who get a little Carmex on their lips before they go out from me their Moms! They also get a little jar flavored tubes in their Christmas stockings... all these years later at 60 yrs old it's still my go to lip quencher season after season a Christmas stocking favorite!"

We were in the hot sun all day and at the end of the day I had a blister on my lip that looked like a cigarette had been put out on my lip. A fellow soldier suggested Carmex. I was given some and it worked like a charm healing this burn and preventing any more burns. Since that time, May 2003, I returned to southern Iraq in 2009 and spent January 2011 to February 2013 in Kandahar Province Afghanistan, and every time I took a good supply of Carmex that saved my lips from burning from the extreme sun found in the area.I told everyone that if they wanted to send me a care package to please send some Carmex."

From harsh winter weather to scorching summer sun, along with dry lips and a few cold sores thrown in between, Carmex has relieved it all. From the first sight of the jar wanting to be opened, to that unique sound of the tiny lid being screwed off with a pleasant aroma that greets you, and finally to the tingly lip sensation after application...it's happiness to my senses! I use it instead of lipstick for a natural shine several times throughout the day, and at night before bedtime to avoid chapped/dry lips. The Carmex Original Lip Balm Jar will continue to be one of my Wisconsin traditions that I'll highly recommend to my family and friends!"

So, I was out at my local drug store and seen the Carmex and picked up a jar as a last ditch effort - boy, was I so glad that I did! Carmex has been a life saver for me. I know that sounds shallow, but it's the truth. I felt immediate results and my fever blisters healed quickly and the Carmex soothed them.

It's actually the only lipcare that I use--also perfect as a base before I put on lipstick. It just absolutely works. That's it. A lot of other brands work for an hour or few, but with Carmex your lips stay moisturized well, and helps to prevent cold sores, although I don't get them, it's nice to know that it also will care for them.

We were pulling security at the Ziggurat of UR while the Iraqi's had their very first meeting at an attempt at self governance. We were in the hot sun all day and at the end of the day I had a blister on my lip that looked like a cigarette had been put out on my lip. A fellow soldier suggested Carmex. I was given some and it worked like a charm healing this burn and preventing any more burns. Since that time, May 2003, I returned to southern Iraq in 2009 and spent January 2011 to February 2013 in Kandahar Province Afghanistan, and every time I took a good supply of Carmex that saved my lips from burning from the extreme sun found in the area.I told everyone that if they wanted to send me a care package to please send some Carmex."

This is the only lip balm that doesnt irritate my lips. other lip balms and glosses leave my lips numb and itchy, this doesn't. its like a miracle in a jar. i never get cold sores, but i use this like an everyday lip balm. it is wonderful. if you like wearing lipstick, and sometimes have those annoying dry peeling lips, put some of this on your lips while your getting ready, then wipe it of and apply lipstick. i like that its not oily greasy like the blistex in the jar. carmex has the perfect texture. the smell is like the original chapstick smell. lol it kind of reminds me of the smell of a new baby doll's skin. kind of powdery in a way, but i like it. it's so cheap. only 99 cents at my walmart. so worth buying. you wont be disappointed. you can also use it on dry hands as well. it's long lasting too."

I decided to buy it, the jar was so interesting, the price was good, too, but I must admit, my expectations weren't very high. I have a lot of lip balms, and none of them really works. And then... such a big surprise! The menthol, the camphor... these aren't very usual for lip balms, but they did a good job with my lips, together with the other ingredients. It became my favourite balm in the world! I would be sooo happy to try the other products, but, unfortunately, it's impossible to buy these from here, and to bring them from the USA it's too expensive."

When I was a teen there would always be a little jar in my Christmas stocking along with a tube now that I wanted to wear lip gloss. I never went to lip gloss, just my Carmex. As my own daughters came I would put a little Carmex on their lips before they left the house too...they got a little tub in their Christmas stockings. Now I have granddaughters who get a little Carmex on their lips before they go out from me & their Moms! They also get a little jar & flavored tubes in their Christmas stockings... all these years later at 60 yrs old it's still my go to lip quencher season after season & a Christmas stocking favorite!"

This brand has always performed exceptionally, and we have never had a dud. It doesn't impart harsh yeasty flavors to your fermentables.

I have had excellent results when using this for Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. Fermentation has always started quickly and the yeast works fast to produce an alcohol content of somewhere in the 13 range. Moreover, it has worked excellently even when the room temperature hasn't been ideal for making wine. There is no yeasty taste after fermentation. I highly recommend this for full-bodied red wines."

I would say that at the least it is 14-15. In fact, I gave my mom a bottle, she has to mix it with a lower content alcohol (9), and it still knocks her out with one glass. I gave a bottle to another friend and she said that she was ready to sleep after a glass.

2710,Home Brew Ohio,Pectic Enzyme (powder) - 1 Lb.,2015-08-22T05:42:14Z,,,,,I have unclouded fruit/veggie wines!,"I had my doubts when I purchased this stuff, and confess to only buying it to be able to follow a recipe verbatim. But I am very impressed. I made a carrot wine, and decided to use a juicer instead of slicing and soaking in sugar to extract the juices. Using a juicer also extracts the pectin. I was going to deal with a cloudy wine since it'll taste the same anyway. I added a teaspoon of this Pectic Enzyme to every gallon of my mash, and to my surprise, it worked! I had a very thick and cloudy wine after the first racking, but now that the wine has had its second racking and has been fermenting for nearly three months, it is a beautiful clear orange color, with no cloudy qualities to note! Now that I'm a believer, I use it in all of my white or lighter colored wines, and no matter the extraction method I use, I'm getting a nice, clear wine a few months later."

The price was perfect and getting a chance to sample a little bit of everything is even better. My package came boxed very well and in my set I received a bottle of Pinot Grigio Champagne (saving for special occasion). I had a glass of the Chardonnay last night with dinner and it was so refreshing. I've had a variety of whites and have tried to find something that I could have with a nice meal or alone (I am not a fan of white wines), but this one was perfect! Definitely could have a glass of this alone while reading a good book."

When I received these I followed the suggestion of letting the wine sit from shipping, and then to open and let sit in order to breathe. I felt the Cabernet was still to young, it had a very strong bite to it. I don't consider myself an expert, but I know a wine I like and have been taught a lot and am still learning. The Merlot on the other hand was much better! It was smooth and had a deep fruit flavor with mild tannins. I would continue buying this one. I have not tried the Pinot Noir yet. I'm hoping this will be just as satisfying as the Merlot was. I will add to my review once I've opened the bottle. And most of all I love how this company takes some of the proceeds and gives them to wonderful causes. That alone is worth buying this!"

We pretty much couldn't even drink them because they are so sweet, thick and jammy. Like fruit juice. We started with the Pinot Noir and after a few sips, aerating and then a few more sips with dinner, we just poured it out. It did not resemble any Pinot I've had before. So we moved on to the Cabernet - and it was almost the same thing. I haven't tried the Merlot yet but not looking forward to it. If I had bought these at a local shop they would be returned. Unfortunately, I that's not an option since they are open and mail order. Maybe the rest can be frozen for cooking. I do love that this producer gives back to charities, more companies should follow their lead in that respect."

The only one we thought was somewhat decent was the Chardonnay. The funny thing is, we aren't even Chardonnay drinkers! We both thought that one was the only consumable wine. Still bad but the best of the whole lot of wines. Rose was the next best but very tart, pulling slightly sour and not in a good way. Both the Pinot & Cab Sauv were very sour, almost like corked wine tastes. It burned when you drank it, like you were drinking straight rubbing alcohol. Gross! We brought them to the correct temp, let them breathe, etc... but they are just straight up nasty. Was a big disappointment as we were really looking forward to getting them and being on auto-delivery. I'm giving 2 stars since the packaging of wine in the boxes & the shipping was great as well as QVC customer service. I called & explained everything to QVC and immediately received a refund!!

I decided to finally order wine from QVC and went for the mixed case as I do like reds and whites. After trying each variety, I regret the decision. While not horrible, they aren’t good either. These aren’t wines I’d serve to anyone or drink again let alone purchase again. The rosé is a sweet wine no doubt about it, which isn’t my taste, but it was described as being not too sweet. The chardonnay is the strangest tasting chardonnay I’ve ever tasted. It was described as not being too oaky. I guess I like my chardonnay oaky. And the pinot noir, which the “wine expert” repeatedly mispronounced (RED FLAG) was just bland. The cabernet sauvingnon was supposed to be the best of the bunch and it was private reserve after all but just turned out to be disappointing as well. These wines were touted as having a retail value of $20-$25 per bottle but taste more like sub $10 per bottle, which is exactly how much it works out to when you buy the case. You get what you pay for, as they say. And if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Lessons learned in this case."

I enjoy white wine but I don't like sweet, which is why I didn't try the Moscato. I like to enjoy a nice glass of white wine whenever I feel like it. This wine is delightful by the glass - no food necessary. I'm very pleased with my purchase and even more pleased that I purchased it on auto-delivery. I can't wait for my next shipment!

Well anyway my son open a bottle, I had ordered all red. I went over to see if I could with stand the smell. Totally surprised I could, so I decided to try it. Very smooth, no after taste. Not a strong, bitter smell. Had guests over for New Year's eve and they had enjoyed it just as much as I did and my son. Probably will be ordering again."

I ordered the mixed-auto delivery package. The Moscato was indeed sweet (just like you'd expect from a Moscato), and the Syrah was not too bad. I guess I should have said from the outset that I'm a sweet-wine drinker (I like sweet red wines), so the Red was not to my liking because it was too dry. I never drink Chardonnay because they are likewise too dry for me. But, Kevin O'Leary's Chardonnay is my favorite from the entire order! It is awesome, magnificent, and very tasty! I even ordered some Fettuccine just so I could pair it with the Chardonnay. Great find (for me). I'm so glad I ordered the auto-delivery because I can't wait to see what I get in the Spring. Very good wine, Mr. O'Leary."

In fact, even without glasses, this would've been a good value to ship across country. I was skeptical about how nicely the presentation would look in person but the recipients sent a picture and I was floored. It looks gorgeous. And expensive. I can't speak to the quality of the wine, but as far as the overall gift, I am pleased that the recipients are pleased and would purchase again. However, as another reviewer noted and that I did not read before purchasing, there was some risqu little cards included in the gift box that boldly stated let's get naked referring I'm sure to the name of the winery. And also I truly did not even notice the silhouettes of women on the glasses or the tag line we aim to tease on the glasses, which is my fault, but I have to say I did not like that. I feel a bit embarrassed now as I hope the recipients don't confuse my intentions. Fortunately these gifts went to couples with a sense of humor about it but had I sent this to someone more conservative in my life, I would have been so very, very embarrassed."

This is not a fruity oak bomb, nor a lengthy, earthy, subtle cab.Here are my 2-liner tasting notes:Black currant and dark cherry on the nose lead to hints of clove and praline on the palate.

I find it very good when chilled properly. I take it out of the refrigerator an hour before drinking it & it's perfect. It's not to cold or warm. When drunk too cold, it doesn't have much taste. At the proper temp, it becomes much more complex. It has a clean delicate taste of peach & apricot. It's not a heavy chardonnay. No oak, butter or vanilla undertone.

Other reviews I Have read judge this to harshly. Including shipping it is a twelve dollar a bottle wine, I have order many wines for an average of 18.00 a bottle and not nearly as good. . I order 15 cases of wine a least every year, this is a great value in the price range it sells for"
2858,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary Select 12 Bottle Auto-Delivery,2018-01-02T20:20:01Z,,,5,,Loved These Wines,"I am not a wine expert, but I am Italian and like wine. I ordered the white selection and I absolutely love it. I enjoy a glass of wine without the meal attached. My first time ordering Moscato and it is delicious, next favorite is the White Zinfandel. The Chardonnay is also very good. Kevin did an excellent job mixing the favors. I am on auto-delivery so I am able to give them as nice gifts, but not the Moscato."
2859,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary Select 12 Bottle Auto-Delivery,2018-01-02T20:20:01Z,,,5,,Love it not crazy for kevin,"We ordered 12 white and 12 red twice, really like them. Sweet is not a favorite, but it was good."
2860,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary Select 12 Bottle Auto-Delivery,2018-01-02T20:20:01Z,,,2,,I'll choose my own,"Thought this would be a good sampler of wine at a very decent price. The mixed case has some wine that friends liked, some I liked. But overall the case is just non descript. Chardonnay was very light on the oaky taste. Other whites were OK. Meritage is OK. Pinot Noir was unidentifiable as such. Cab Sauv. OK. White Zin? No one wanted it. So I can't say this was a ""wonderful"" assortment. I have cancelled the remainder of the auto ship. Thanks anyway, Kevin. I'll pick my own bottles locally."
2861,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary Select 12 Bottle Auto-Delivery,2018-01-02T20:20:01Z,,,3,,Mediocre at best!,"Not the quality at all that I was expecting from Kevin O'Leary. Very disappointed, and I would not serve this to guests."
2862,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary Select 12 Bottle Auto-Delivery,2018-01-02T20:20:01Z,,,1,,It's not worth the hassle,"Definitely not worth the hassle, don't waste your time or your money"

2864,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary Select 12 Bottle Auto-Delivery,2017-11-15T17:05:21Z,,,5,,Better than expected,"First, before I purchase a wine for a second time I need to sample it. Not possible this way of course so I relied on QVC and Kevin O'Leary's reputation for making my purchase.So far I have been very pleased with the quality and taste of each of the reds in the collection, a great value for the quality and proud to serve it to guests. Look forward to next auto-ship and purchasing the white collection."
2865,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary Select 12 Bottle Auto-Delivery,2017-09-25T16:31:30Z,,,5,,ALWAYS A HIT!!,LOVE LOVE LOVE Kevin's Reserve Wines. Just the best! 5th or 6th time ordering and will continue to order more and auto delivery. FANTASTIC deal on really great wine! Can't go wrong! A no brainer! If you love wine...DO IT!
2866,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 12 Bottle Set,2018-01-02T20:20:02Z,,,5,,Glad we purchased this wine,Had this wine for a few months and finally got around to tasting...we ordered the 12 bottle sampler set and we are loving the Chardonnay and the Syrah...cannot wait to taste the others...Will order again.
2867,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 12 Bottle Set,2018-01-02T20:20:02Z,,,2,,Not very good,I'm not a wine snob but I've had my fair share of wine over the years. I taste new brands fairly regularly. You can do much better at your local store for the same or less money. Basically tastes like a good box wine. Black Box ... etc.
2868,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 12 Bottle Set,2018-01-02T20:20:02Z,,,5,,Excellent value,The Cabernet is a true value. The Chardonnay is also great.
2869,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 12 Bottle Set,2018-01-02T20:20:02Z,,,5,,consistently smooth and delicious,"We have ordered both white and red sets of O'Leary wines more than once, and we have had consistently excellent wine with every single bottle.The sweet wines are delicate and blended perfectly without being too sweet. The rich reds are deep without being too tannic or biting. When we need a wine we can count on to be perfect for guests, or gifts or just enjoying with our everyday meals, this is our go-to wine.We recommend it highly."
2870,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 12 Bottle Set,2018-01-02T20:20:02Z,,,1,,Worst Ever,I purchased these to give as gifts last year and when I tried the wine myself I spit it out and was mortified.I was so embarrassed that I gave these wines to people I know that I had to apologize and give another gift.This is by far some of the worst swill I’ve ever had.There are wines that are the same price from California wineries that are far superior.I would not even cook with this stuff.I wish I had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back. This is what they had in mind when they coined the expression “rot gut”.
2871,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 12 Bottle Set,2018-01-02T20:20:02Z,,,1,,Don't bother...,"If you're a selective wine drinker, don't buy this. It's mediocre at best. Will likely end up using for cooking."
2872,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 12 Bottle Set,2018-01-02T20:20:02Z,,,2,,Barely average wine,"I wish I had returned this wine, but only gradually used and each bottle was less than satisfying. Have ordered Vintage Wine Estates wine a few times before and very much enjoyed. O'Lerary's reserve wines were not of the same quality in my opinion and in the opinion of my book club members. Not sure if they were left in the heat somewhere along the way or just what, but just no happy with these and would not order again. Kevin presents himself as quite the wine producer and he is likely quite knowledgeable, but there is better wine available at lower cost."
2873,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 12 Bottle Set,2018-01-02T20:20:02Z,,,2,,Not Happy With Auto Delivery,"Purchased on auto delivery. First shipment great, second came with 6 bottle of sav but no moscato. We do not like the sav but are now stuck with all these bottles. Third shipment came with the moscato and 3 more sav. Shipped well before they said it would or at least they said in process so we could not delay or skip shipment. Moscato is great others are ok. Trying to cancel balance and would order the moscato and other whites but price with shipping even ""included"" makes it costly. Disappointed."
2874,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 12 Bottle Set,2017-12-16T08:00:39Z,,,4,,Good mix,"I'm really picky about wine. To be honest, I've had cheap wine that is good and more expensive wine that is not good. A good wine to me has a good balance. I actually really really liked the moscato. Moscato is my favorite type of wine and I've had a lot that I don't care for. If you like Bartenura, you will appreciate this. I liked the white zin also. I didn't care for the chardonnay, but my husband said it was ""ok."" I'd like to get the 3 bottle pack that you can choose, but the current price makes the 3 bottle pack more expensive per bottle. I'd say all in all, this is a decent middle of the road group of wines. The moscato impressed me the most. For those who haven't heard of the bartenura comparison, it's a $11-16 bottle, so it puts it right in about the same class as O'Leary. If you're curious about this, if say take a chance. Regardless how I feel about the taste of the chardonnay, they are all quite fragrant which I enjoy."
2875,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 12 Bottle Set,2017-12-01T08:01:02Z,,,2,,Not what I was hoping for,"I purchased the 12 bottle mixed package to sample something new to me in the rose and meritage. I usually drink Pinot Noir and Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio. I wish the wines lived up to their descriptions, but sadly they did not. I realize tastes are subjective, but for me, the Chardonnay was very tart and without any full taste. I would not order these again.."
2876,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 12 Bottle Set,2017-11-15T17:05:21Z,,,2,,"Cab is good, Pinot is not","I am a Pinot Noir wine drinker generally, but the Pinot Noir in this case is terrible, even after decanting. Have tried two of the Pinot bottles and a few of each of the others. I actually prefer the Cab over anything in the case and I usually don't like cabs."
2877,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 12 Bottle Set,2017-11-15T17:05:21Z,,,1,,Worst Purchase I Have Ever Made!,"Can't believe that I was so stupid to fall for Kevin O'Leary's promotion of his wines. I believed in him, and therefore went ahead and purchased the variety.dozen bottles. What a fool I have been! I wanted to give him the benefit of doubt, but I continue to be disappointed. Yes, I know I have a month to return the merchandise! What a laugh!! How to return a huge package? I poured most in the kitchen sink... live and learn."

2880,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 3 Bottle Set,2018-01-02T20:20:02Z,,,3,,I EXPECTED MORE FLAVOR,"I was really hopeful that I would experience a new tasting wine just because it's ""Mr. Wonderful's"" brand. However it was not as flavorful as what I had become accustomed. It's not bad it's just okay. I purchased the Zinfandel. I wanted the Moscato but it had sold out. I still may go back later and purchase it because it might be exactly what I'm looking to purchase. I would still recommend this product because everyone has a different expectation when it comes to wine tasting."
2881,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 3 Bottle Set,2018-01-02T20:20:02Z,,,1,,Not Very Good,I purchased the Pinot Noir and it was terrible. Dumping it and won’t purchase again .
2882,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 3 Bottle Set,2018-01-02T20:20:02Z,,,5,,Ordered More Than Once,"I only like sweet (not super sweet) wine and the Moscato is absolutely delicious. I'm not one to drink it with the suggested food pairings. I'll have it with anything because it tastes that good. Like it before, during, or after dinner. It just tastes great. This is really good wine and the price is good too."

2886,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 3 Bottle Set,2018-01-02T20:20:02Z,,,5,,Excellent,I only like a sweet wine. I was skeptical on ordering without tasting it first. I am so glad I ordered it. I love it. THANKS KEVIN O'LEARY!!!
2887,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 3 Bottle Set,2018-01-02T20:20:02Z,,,5,,Delicious !!,I ordered a 3 bottle set of both the Meritage & Moscata wines for friends who did me a huge favor and most definitely know their wines. They called me to say they thought these were both the best they had tasted in awhile !! Said they were thoroughly enjoying them and when they finished this set planned to order these 3 bottle sets on their own as they want to try all varieties !! Thanks Kevin & QVC for a hit !!
2888,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 3 Bottle Set,2017-12-16T08:00:39Z,,,5,,Sumptuous delicious wine.,"I ordered the White Zinfadel in the 3 bottle selection which arrived on Friday. This wine is absolutely one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. My husband and I visited Nappa Wine Valley and Sonoma Wineries about 3 years ago. Our hats off to Mr. Kevin O'Leary to bring such a joy, a truly inspired new one which can certainly hold it's own. We had company yesterday and everyone remarked as to how well it is done. Thank you so much for this wonderful offering."
2889,Vintage Wine Estates,Vintage Wine Estates Kevin O'Leary's Select Reserve 3 Bottle Set,2017-11-15T17:05:21Z,,,5,,Excellent Moscato,This was my first purchase of these wines. Tried the Moscato as I like a sweet wine. Found it to be the best I've ever had. The only drawback to ordering wine on line is having to be home for the delivery. Missed the UPS guy a couple times.
