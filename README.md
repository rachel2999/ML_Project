# ML_Project
This project creates three machine learning models to predict the rating of wine and other drinks based on reviews. There is one classical model (logistic regression model) and two neural network models (classification model & deep model). 

It uses a "Wine Reviews" dataset which consists of over 2,000 reviews of various wine brands and other alcoholic drinks by users. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krrai77/wine-reviews
